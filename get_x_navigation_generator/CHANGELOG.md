## 0.0.x (2023-03-xx)

- Added support to specify `customTransition`, `transition`, `transitionDurationInMilliseconds`, `participatesInRootNavigator`, `title`, `maintainState`, `opaque`, `popGesture` and `showCupertinoParallax` for generated methods

## 0.0.11 (2023-03-02)

- Added `popUntil` and `goBackTo` methods on the generated navigator
- Added support for `navigatorId` on the generated methods to be able to use nested navigators

## 0.0.10 (2023-02-17)

- Added support for multiple annotations on the same class so you can generate multiple methods for a single page (use routeName to specify the name of the method and route)

## 0.0.9 (2023-02-08)

- Added NavigationType.dialog and getXDialog annotation
- Added support for suffixes, this removes `screen`, `page` and `view` from the route name (or any suffix you specify)

## 0.0.8 (2023-01-30)

- Added a `closeDialog` method to the generated navigator
- Changed NavigationType.popAllAndPush to NavigationType.pushAndReplaceAll so it's more in line with the Flutter API
